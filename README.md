# EatSafe

This project is developed by two French developers as part of a course at the ECV Digital School of Bordeaux.
By launching this project, you'll be able to follow an example of meal on the week, based on the OMS
bests recommendations.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.
See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites and running
First, you must need [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) and Gulp on your computer. If not, please install it before running this project.  
Next, you can copy this repo: 

```
git clone https://github.com/Bran72/eatSafe.git
```

To run the project, you simply have to run the following command *(please make sure you're on the root path of the project)*:
```
cd eatSafe
gulp
```

**If the `gulp` command doesn't work, please run `npm run gulp`.**

## How it works
The functionning of this app is pretty simple: when you launch it, you can sign up (or sign in, if it's not the first launch).  
After this step, you'll must be able to access to your menu: in the beginning, the menu is based on the OMS recommandations, but don't be afraid ! If
you don't like our suggest, you can edit the menu by clicking on each days and aliments.

## Built With
